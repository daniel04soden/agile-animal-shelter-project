## Project Proposal

### Team: Daniel Soden, Gavin Moore, Fawaz Olatunji & Ben Murphy

### Problem statement

- Across many first world countries, animals are too often forced to surrender to shelters due to illness, injury and financial challenges faced by owners. This pressing issue creates a major need to find the root cause that drives these pets or strays into shelters and the outcomes they are likely to experience during their stay. Throughout this project, we will leverage machine learning as a means of looking into a sample from Austin Texas that provides the context we need to identify patterns present in shelters globally.

### Scope

- The project will focus on the data given from Austin Texas however it provides a comprehensive case study to understand where and how these animals are found and what happens to the animals in these shelters. The analysis will explore characteristics of these animals like their gender,age, reason and time period of these abandoned animals.

### Stakeholders

- The value of this project will pertain to three major groups:

- Pet owners wanting to make sure they are fit to never need to resort to leaving their animals in a shelter

- Shelter workers who need more information on common intake patterns and what traits do they need to focus on to improve animals' likelihood of adoption.

- Animal welfare organizations looking for data driven guidance on how to improve adoption strategies and reduce unnecessary euthanasia

### Objective

- The goal of this project is to analyse the Animal center dataset and identify patterns in animal intakes and outcomes in order to provide predictive insights that support better adoption decisions and animal welfare practices.

### Dataset: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics>

- The dataset we have chosen has ample size, having roughly 124,000 rows of data in the intake dataset alone. There is a wide variety of data present, qualitative such as the animals gender, color and species or the quantitative data i.e. through queries, the number of animals left due to old age or the date/time they were left. This dataset also includes map co-ordinates for where particular animals were found. Although seemingly unreadable to humans, once the AI model is trained, we will be able to ask arbitrary questions such as “Where are brown cats usually found?” or “Are bats ever found injured in homes?”. In my opinion through further scrubbing,combinations and other fixes this dataset will provide a wide but concise context window for any questions that may arise relating to animal shelters not only in Texas but also globally.
